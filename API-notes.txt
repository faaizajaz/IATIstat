More interesting analysis:
- which countries fund what
- which orgs report
- how frequently do orgs report
- comparing reported against published budgets

- make helpre function to convert sectors list to sector categories list
- modify main org sector component to take arbitrary number of target years
- modify home component to pass list of target dates as props

now i can pass a bunch of years as argument and get it back either by category or sector
